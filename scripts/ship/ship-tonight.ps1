 SCRIPT-VERSION: v1  (Sep 28 2026, the night)

 Ships branch redesign/tonight: everything built on the night of Sep 28 2026,
 after AJ's "lets try to complete all rounds tonight and get it to master".
 53 commits on master's 1c38174:

   - AJ's three answers to the voice review notes (was ship-review-decisions,
     which this replaces: run THIS one instead): a studio's machine knowledge
     stays with the studio, sharing with all MSF studios waits for an
     administrator (Admins -> Waiting for review), and how often a studio asks
     Mindbody is administrators' alone. docs/rounds/2026-09-28-voice-review-notes.md
   - The Relay room: one header, the Board, Board - Tracker - Journal, the
     Tracker, Opening and Close out, the Ask sheet and the open-questions
     trail. docs/rounds/2026-09-28-relay.md
   - The Operations room: Today - Week - Clients - Team - Setup, one rule for
     where a client is, the Monday review, Team and the huddle.
     docs/rounds/2026-09-28-operations.md
   - The Admins room: the Command Center (Home - Studios - Standard -
     Machinery). docs/rounds/2026-09-28-admins.md
   - The Machine Catalog room: Find and the names, Our floor, the body and All
     MSF, and the codex source check (docs only). docs/rounds/2026-09-28-catalog.md
   - The Hub's cherry on top: your column in words, the Next 30 minutes,
     Me / Everyone. docs/rounds/2026-09-28-hub-cherry.md
   - The Local set-up fix: never on a studio's own machine.

 No Mindbody call, no index, no Cloud Functions change, no server change.
 One rules change (the voice review notes' three answers), which NARROWS
 access. It still goes before the app: the app the iPads run now only reads
 its own studio's machines, notes and set-up, and for the few minutes until
 the new app is live a studio's Share tap or a leader's sync change is
 refused with a message.

 Run from the project folder, with the folder on the branch (ask Claude to
 switch it; do not switch branches by hand), IN ORDER:

   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\ship\ship-tonight.ps1 -Stage prepare
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\ship\ship-tonight.ps1 -Stage golive

 prepare  changes nothing (it writes only logs\ and the build folder). In
          order: the branch, a clean tree, the fetch, that master already
          holds 1c38174, that the branch fast-forwards master, what goes live,
          that functions\, server\ and firestore.indexes.json are unchanged,
          the rules change listed, the Firebase login (golive needs it), the
          case check, the typecheck COUNT (4), the suite in Eastern time, the
          rules tests (THE run that counts; port 8080 checked first, and the
          emulator a run leaves behind on this PC is stopped), the build.
          Ends PREPARE PASSED and writes logs\ship-tonight.prepared.

 golive   refuses unless that file still names the branch's commit and
          master as they are now. Then it asks for GO, and in order:
            1. tags master as it is now (restore/2026-09-28-before-tonight)
               and pushes the tag;
            2. deploys firestore.rules to production (project 'prod');
            3. pushes redesign/tonight to master, fast-forward only:
               RENDER DEPLOYS THE APP.
          It stops at the first failure; nothing after it runs. It never
          deploys indexes or functions.

 To undo the app: push the restore tag to master (ask Claude). To undo the
 rules: deploy firestore.rules from the restore tag (ask Claude).
